# Database configuration

# Database connectivity for elements database
# You will need a local postgres database to test with data (as opposed to mock), since
# H2 does not support the interval data type.
# E.g., set up a database using `createdb elements`

# You should add a personal configuration file called development.conf in your conf directory
# with settings that are useful in dev mode; e.g., the database settings (see above), as
# well as the following:
#play.http.router = elements.Routes
#mail.override.address = "<your-email>"
#play.evolutions.db.authorization.autoApply=true
